# To do the GDP analysis of Indian states.
For each of the following steps of analysis, choose an appropriate type of plot for comparing the data. Also, ensure that the plots are in increasing or decreasing order for better comparison. For example, if you make a bar plot to compare the GDPs of the states, ensure that the bars are in either increasing or decreasing order of GDP.

 

Part I-A:

For the analysis below, use the Data I-A.

First, you need to load the data in Python properly and then clean it. This also involves the treatment of missing values, you can choose to drop the row or column as well. Remember this will affect your next analysis and results drastically.

Plot a graph for rows " % Growth over previous year" for all the states (not union territories) whose data is available, use as much data as possible for this exercise. Use the best fit line to represent the growth for each state. Draw a similar line graph for the nation as well.

How will you compare the growth rates of any two states?

Which states have been growing consistently fast, and which ones have been struggling? Rank top 3 fastest and 3 slowest-growing states.

What is the Nation's growth rate?
What has been the growth rate of your home state, and how does it compare to the national growth rate?
Plot the total GDP of the states for the year 2015-16:

Which Plot will you use for this? Why? (Remeber to plot the graph in a way such as it is easier to read and compare)

Identify the top 5 and the bottom 5 states based on total GDP.

What insights can you draw from this graph? What states are performing poorly? (Remember: this will not be solely based on total GDP)
